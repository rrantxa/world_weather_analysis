# World Weather Analysis.
### Brief Summary of the Project
This project was done for the "PlanMyTrip" app. The purpose was to generate weather data for different world cities that would allow users to get recommendations based on their weather preferences. For this we did the following:
1.  We used the Open Weather App and the Google Maps API's in order to get weather and city data.
2. We retrieved the coordinates, names and weather conditions of over 700 cities.
3. We used the Google Maps API to get the names of nearby hotels for each of them. 
3. We mapped the cities, their weather conditions and nearby hotels using the Pandas gmaps module.
